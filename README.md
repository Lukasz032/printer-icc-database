This repository contains a public database of user-generated **ICC/ICM profiles for use
with inkjet printers and photo papers**.

All profiles you can find here are created using state-of-the-art tools like X-Rite i1Studio or X-Rite i1Photo Pro.

## General info
* Profiles available here are sorted in **folders** nested in the following fashion:
  1. Printer brand
  2. Printer model, series or family (in this case, also with print head model)
  3. Paper brand
  4. Paper family name + characteristics (matt/satin/glossy, grammage, etc.)
* The profile **file name** contains also the ink (brand, model) used in their creation.
* We don't categorize printers by their destined market segment, price or any subjective qualifiers. Only the "hard"
  material data, in other words what's _actually useful_ to distinguish two different profiles, counts.
* All profiles listed here are either _currently_ in production use by _someone_, or have been used
  in production by _someone_ before.
* We accept contributions in the form of ICC profiles that meets the criteria listed above - the contributed profile
  needs to be in production use by either the party contributing itself, or its client.
  * Contributed profiles need to specify for which printer (or print head, if used in multiple devices
    of a manufacturer), which paper and on which ink they are created, as all of those are distinguishing factors,
	making significant color differences.
  * All contributors also need to certify the profile submitted is created by a state-of-the-art profiling tool,
    capable of generating high-precision printer profiles. For now, X-Rite is a preferred brand of colorimeters
	in device profiling.

## Licensing
* All profiles listed here are published by their authors under the terms of a **Creative Commons
  Attribution - No Derivatives 4.0 license**, unless otherwise specified.
* Profile authors are either actual commit authors, specified by the file name, or listed specifically
  in the folder descriptions, if it's not directly possible to retain authorship information on a certain file.
* **Contributors agree to have their profile licensed on the terms specified above** and are granting
  the repository operator a non-exclusive right to host their contributed profiles inside this repository
  for an indefinite period of time.
